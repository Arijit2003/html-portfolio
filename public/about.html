<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Meow! That’s the only thing you hear from me. I have seen you wonder how I can speak using only one sound. Well, it seems quite an easy language with just one word in my dictionary. So you think my life is a bed of roses huh? Then let me tell you my story.

 I am a cat and I was born right under your cot. No need to check now. It was long ago. Momma cat used to bring me food the first few weeks of my birth. That was indeed a golden time. We don’t have any formal names like you do. But momma called me ‘meoaw’ affectionately. I loved her very much.</p>
<p>Suddenly one day, ‘a black cat’ crossed my road. No, I am not being racist. I meant the black cat which you think is unfortunate. I woke up from my nap one afternoon and found my tummy rumbling. It was my lunch time and momma had not returned yet.  “She must not have found something today and is still searching. Oh, poor momma!” I thought.

 “She should give in for today. I can go without food for one day. I wish I could contact her.” I said to myself.

But we don’t have those cell phones you carry, on which you can talk to each other standing at any position on this planet. I decided to wait a little longer but could not find any sign of her. So I stepped out of my cocoon to begin my search and witness the world around on my own. I walked a few miles and then saw people gathered in the middle of the street. “Is there any festival going there?” I asked. I took a few steps further, trying to break through the fence of men. I tried to make my way through their legs when I heard someone saying, “Who is going to throw this cat carcass?”.

“What did she say? What is a carcass? But they mentioned the word cat” I said.

 So out of anxiety I peeped through the legs of those men and got a glimpse of white fur. Moving my head further ahead I saw there,my mother lying on the road, almost smashed.  I didn’t know what to do. I was completely numb. Someone picked her up by a tool and put her in a bag and walked ahead.

“What.. Where are you taking her? Meaaoow.. meaaooow.” I screamed running after the man. I don’t think anyone noticed because all they did was put her in a garbage van and take her somewhere. I don’t remember much of that now.

For the next few days, I was completely broken. I sat in the corner and wept, out of grief and hunger. We don’t have any funerals like you. Neither do we have Life Insurances stating if he/she dies you will get a free bowl of milk twice daily. She was my only family. Momma said my brothers and sisters had died at birth.
