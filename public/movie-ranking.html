<h1>The Best Movies According to Arijit</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>3 idiots</h3>
<p>Three Idiots’ is a remarkable ahead of its time Bollywood blockbuster.
This film is a comedy movie with strong acting, memorable characters, a perplexing
storyline and most importantly, highly motivational movie to choose the right path 
in your life.</p>

<h3>Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan</h3>
<p>Very touching tribute to courage shown by Major Sandeep and the movie also 
tries to depict the sacrifice a soldier has to make . It's a very tough choice 
and a job which doesn't get deserving respect from common public. Rest In Peace 
Major and thanks you for your service.</p>

<h3>Rocketry</h3>
<p>Thank you R Madhavan for bringing this truth on Big screen 👍❤️😍👏
